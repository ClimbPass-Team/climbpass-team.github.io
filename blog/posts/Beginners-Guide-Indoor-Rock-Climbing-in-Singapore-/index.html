    <h3></h3>
    <p>The last time I did rock climbing—or more specifically, top rope climbing—was at the age of 11, at
Outward Bound Singapore. That was 9 years ago.</p>

<p>Now at the incoming age of 20 and returning to the sport, it’s hard not to feel like a chicken learning to
fly. I mean, a few feet of the feat is possible, but to go all the way up there?</p>

<p>As much as the thought is exhilarating, there’s bound to be some intimidation involved.</p>

<p>Perhaps it’s the heights, the onslaught of rock climbing terminology to learn, or maybe if you’re like me, you don’t fancy standing alone like a socially awkward person battling with the indecision of asking
someone for help.</p>

<p>But fret not.</p>

<p>Whether you’re a teenager looking for something cool and fulfilling to do, a working professional trying to blow off some steam from work, or a retiree wanting to spend some meaningful time with their
family, here are some important things to take note of before starting your rock climbing journey.</p>

    <h3>1) Focus on Good Form and Movement before Speed. </h3>
    <p>Becoming the Spiderman of the climbing community on Day 1 is an alluring thought, but it is important to learn how to climb with the correct technique first. Doing so maximizes efficiency as less strength is
needed and you’ll feel less tired as you proceed on to more challenging climbs.</p>

<p>The size, shape, and orientation of the handholds and footholds will determine how you grasp or rest on them. The best way to position your body depends on the rock steepness and locations of the holds.</p>

<p>There are a myriad of ways to improve your form and movement. You may read climbing books or blogs,
watch climbing videos, observe good climbers in action, attend a climbing class or practice in a climbing
gym.</p>

<p>Useful YouTube channels to get you started:

    <h3>2) Wear the Right Comfortable Clothing. </h3>
    <p>Most often, a simple t-shirt and trousers will do. It’s important that your clothes strike a Goldilocks
balance between tightness and looseness. We want an attire that is as non-restrictive as possible,
allowing us to reach, bend, twist and move easily when climbing. However, we want to avoid excess
bagginess which may hamper our movements as well.</p>

<p>If you’re a student, you may have your old school shirts and shorts to wear. As for adults, one of your
usual exercise attire or casual outing outfit should work as well (bring out the yoga pants, so they say!).</p>

<p>As for footwear, you aren’t allowed to wear anything that’s not a climbing shoe when climbing. This
means even sneakers, the closest resemblance to climbing shoes you most likely own aren’t allowed as
well.</p>

<p>However, you can rent climbing shoes from the indoor climbing gym. In fact, you’ll even have a better
climbing experience for the climbing shoes will provide you with a much better grip of the wall than
normal sport shoes.</p>

<p>Most importantly, don’t forget thin socks!</p>

    <h3>3) Learn the Lingo.</h3>
    <p>It’s good to familiarize yourself with some rock climbing commands beforehand so that you can
understand and communicate better with others while climbing.</p>

<p>After all, why say “My arms are aching worse than Atlas holding the world and I desperately need you to
remove all slack of the rope so that I may help myself to some much needed rest” when you can
smoothly throw out to your belayer, “Tension!” and get the job done.</p>

<p>3 common commands you’ll hear (other than “tension”) and their corresponding answers are:</p>

    <h3>4) Safety is of utmost priority.</h3>
    <p>The above 3 points are built, in some sense, upon the foundation of safety. Indoor rock climbing is not as
dangerous as you may think, given the strict safety measures taken by the climbing gyms in Singapore.</p>

<p>Just like any form of exercise, you should warm up before climbing. This loosen your joints and increase
blood flow to your muscles, improving your climbing performance. It prepares your body for sudden
movements or a longer stretch.</p>

<p>Additionally, you should take the necessary precautions beforehand if you have any old injury. For
instance, I always wear a knee guard when climbing after a corrective surgery for a torn knee ligament
years ago. You should check with your doctor if rock climbing is suitable for you, and if yes, at what
intensity.</p>

<p>Furthermore, if you experience any pain or sense anything wrong with the equipment while climbing,
stop. It’s okay if you didn’t reach your goal and it’s okay if there is no outward appearance or hard
evidence of what may not be right. It’s always better to be safe than sorry.</p>

</div>
<br/><br/><div class="section text-content">
    <h3>5) Hence, Learn to Fall Properly</h3>
    <p>For bouldering, the best way to learn is to fall. The grounds in the climbing gyms are usually padded with
thick mattresses to cushion the impact of your fall. Always fall away from the wall so that you won’t
scape your shins or lose a tooth or two as you hit the protrusions of the wall.</p>

<p>Always bend your knees upon landing to absorb the impact and avoid fracturing your shins or breaking
your ankles by accident. Don’t lean forward too much with your arms sticking out in front of you, lest
you break them.</p>

<p>Additionally, avoid dropping into a deep squat as you land as it hurts your knees and you may knee
yourself in the face in the process. If you’re unsure on how to land properly, your next best option is to
drop sideways with your knees, hips and then shoulders onto the ground or simply land on your bum.</p>

<p>It’s normal and okay to fear falling; you can start off by jumping off the wall and practicing your landing
at a lower height. It all goes back to the concept of safety as your top priority.</p>

<br/><br/><div class="section text-content">
    <h3>6) No One is Looking at You.</h3>
    <p>It’s easy to feel self-conscious at times when the knowledge of your knobby knees, dangling digits and
shoddy sloth movements weighs on your mind like a thousand tons. Perhaps you’re fifty-two, wondering
what on earth you’re doing at a place filled with most people the age of your kids.</p>

<p>Either way, the thing is that no one is judging you as hard as you are yourself. Remember, those better
climbers that you see today were once like you, fledglings who probably have their own share of
mortifying stories too.</p>

<p>More importantly, know that it’s perfectly alright to be rock climbing regardless of your age, size, fitness
level or limited experience. It’s not a rat race or beauty contest.</p>

<p>Your goal can be to grow fitter, challenge yourself, have fun or bond with others and so on. At the end of
the day, the only person whose opinion matters is you.</p>

    <h3>7) Need Help? Just Ask.</h3>
    <p>Don’t worry, strangers aren’t vultures. They won’t eat you up for wasting their time or asking simplistic
questions. In fact, most are happy to help and flattered that you would even think of them as a
candidate to seek expert directions from.</p>

<p>One thing I’ve learnt about the climbing community in Singapore is that the people are rather friendly
and quite enthusiastic to spread the joy of rock climbing, be it as a hobby, exercise or competitive sport.</p>

<p>Who knows, that stranger may eventually become your good friend or even something more…</p>

<br/><br/><div class="section text-content">
    <h3>In Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Whatever your reasons and goals are for joining rock climbing, don’t let your fear and doubts stop you.</p>

<p>Rock climbing is beautiful and challenging in the sense that it pushes you to the limits of your skill,
strength, and stamina. Figuring out which routes to take and the method you want to use to get there is
like a lovely and exciting puzzle. Partnering up with others to climb is a wonderful social experience of
camaraderie.</p>

<p>And it all begins with the first step.</p>

    <h3>1) It is dangerous.</h3>
    <p>You’re right in the sense that falling from high heights is dangerous, but the process of rock climbing isn’t as dangerous as you may think.</p>
<p>In Singapore, every climbing gym or program takes the safety of its users as top priority.</p>
<p>For top rope climbing, equipment such as harnesses, helmets and ropes are checked regularly to ensure that they are fully functional before being loaned out to climbers.</p>
<p>Most sites are also overseen by experienced crew members to ensure no accidents occur. For first-time climbers, you will most likely expect to be given a safety briefing too.</p>
<p>Additionally, one has to pass a verification test examined by a qualified instructor if they were to use their own personal climbing equipment. In Singapore, we follow the Singapore National Climbing Standards which is overseen by the <a href="http://www.smf.org.sg/" target="_blank">Singapore Mountaineering Federation</a>.</p>



<p>As for bouldering, the rock walls are usually around 3-5 meters in height with a heavily padded ground to cushion the fall of climbers. As long as you learn how to fall properly such as falling away from the wall, bending your knees upon landing or landing on your bum, it’s quite a safe and fun activity to be engaging in.</p>
<p>Furthermore, just as with any other sport, you’ll reduce your chances of pulling a muscle while climbing with some good old warm-up exercises beforehand.</p>
<p>Of course, you may have an old injury or medical condition which you’re concerned about. For that, it’s best if you check with your physiotherapist or doctor to see if rock climbing is suitable for you and if yes, at what intensity.</p>

    <h3>2) It is expensive.</h3>
    <p>Climbing is not as cheap as running or other activities which you can do for free outside since you have to pay for access to special climbing gyms or programs in Singapore.</p> 
<p>Additionally, as you proceed onto higher levels of the sport, you may want to buy specialized equipment that cost almost an arm and a leg.</p>
<p>But there are ways you can make it more affordable.</p>
<p>Ultimately it depends on how you stretch your budget and what stage of climbing you’re at. Let’s just do some of the cost breakdown together.</p>
<p>Here is a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JvqEmMA2X25p_b95894EwTEUr6pPXDJT/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">rough guide</a> <i>(numbers correct upon 2 Sep 2020)</i> on the possible services and equipment you’ll expect to spend on at each “stage”, but it’s entirely up to you to buy or not buy certain items, as well as <i>how many of them</i>.</p>

<p>As the guide shows, the cost of rock climbing as a hobby can climb (no pun intended) up to hundreds while going pro can go up to the thousands.</p>
<p>Overall, it’s cheaper if you get a bundle package of lessons or multi-passes which most climbing gyms in Singapore do offer, though at differing rates.</p>
<p>Basically, the cost of climbing depends on what you need and what you’re getting. If it’s worth more renting, you should rent. If it’s financially sensible to buy, you should buy.</p>
<p>And you don’t need to get the most expensive item when a cheaper one does equally well or suits your minimum requirements.</p>
<p>Climbing is costly, but with a little planning you may fit it into your budget.</p>

    <h3>3) It’s only for youngsters.</h3>
    <p>Nope. While the colourful, Instagram-worthy rock walls and their imposing heights may position rock climbing as an activity more for thrill-seeking youths than middle-aged adults or seniors, this doesn’t mean that those of the latter group can’t or shouldn’t do climbing.</p>
<p>As long you’re relatively healthy and mobile and curious about the sport, just go for it. It’s not shameful or embarrassing to be the only “oldie” on site. In fact, you may even find that people are more open and willing to help you because of your mature age.</p>
<p>Never stop trying out new things despite your age, yo!</p>

<br/><br/><div class="section text-content">
    <h3>4) It’s difficult to pick up.</h3>
    <p>Not really. There are numerous climbing routes of varying difficulty, some catered to beginners. In fact, some of the routes are as straightforward as climbing a ladder, just that instead of steps you get climbing <br>holds.</p>
<p>Just as how a 9 months old baby probably wouldn’t think of walking as effortless or natural, the same applies to you with rock climbing at your current stage.</p>
<p>Baby steps, that’s what you need to take.</p>
<p>Practice and pick yourself up even after falling and over time, you’ll definitely improve, perhaps even proceeding on to more difficult climbs.</p>

<br/><br/><div class="section text-content">
    <h3>5) It’s only for fit people.</h3>
    <p>While it’s true that a decent amount of upper and lower body strength is required as you proceed on to more challenging climbs, you shouldn’t be disheartened if you haven’t got the bulging arms, abs line and toned calves to begin rock climbing.</p>
<p>Strength and stamina can be built subsequently.</p>
<p>As a beginner, you’ll realise that technique is more important than brute strength. At times, it can even compensate for the lack of strength. Being a good climber means knowing how to use your energy efficiently.</p>
<p>Hence, even if the only sit-up you do daily is getting out of bed, don’t let the lack of fitness or strength stop you from at least trying rock climbing out.</p>

<br/><br/><div class="section text-content">
    <h3>6) You need a climbing partner.</h3>
    <p>It’s true that you’ll need a belayer for top rock climbing. But if you haven’t got anyone to join you, you can try out bouldering, which can be done alone. Alternatively, you could ask someone at the climbing gym if they would be willing to act as your belayer.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you’re the only on within your family and circle of friends who is interested in rock climbing, you could always sign up for climbing classes where you’ll meet people like you and practice climbing together.</p>
<p>In fact, be sure to check out our <a href="https://t.me/climbjios" target="_blank">Telegram: ClimbJios</a> to meet people with a passion for climbing in Singapore!</p>

    <h3>7) It’s not for people who are scared of heights.</h3>
    <p>That’s a sweeping statement because our apprehension of heights can range from mildly concerned to full out phobia. The best judge of the extent of your fear is actually yourself. If you know you’re scared of heights (or more precisely, scared of falling) but think that it’s not too crippling to stop you from trying <br>out rock climbing, then go for it.</p>
<p>Maybe you’ll find that it’s not as bad as it seems. Perhaps the greatness of the view from above will supersede any uncertainty you have earlier. And in any case you change your mind and want to stop half-way, no one will force you to continue.</p>
<p>In fact, there’s no need to reach the top. I got to only 2 meters above ground the first time I tried bouldering, stuck and shaking. The most important thing is at least you tried.</p>
</div>
<br/><br/><div class="section text-content">
    <h3>In summary,</h3>
    <p>People aren’t wrong when they say things like rock climbing are dangerous, expensive and difficult to pick up. But to what extent? To make any decision, we’ll need to dig deeper behind the opinions of others to see a clearer picture of the truth for ourselves.</p>
<p>So with that clearer picture in mind now, what are your thoughts on rock climbing?</p>
<p>Fancy a climb?</p>
